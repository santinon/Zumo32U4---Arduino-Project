# Zumo32U4---Arduino-Project
Some codes as different examples that will help you to understand basics (and advanced) commands in order to control
your robot and to better understand how it works. The goal is that you have enough knowledge to program it for a robot
competition in the end. 
I did this tutorial by adding a lot of comments and tried to simplify (on my way) the code of my teacher that you can find
on this joined link : https://github.com/jgrizou/CRI-UE-Robotics (good course and very nice Github).

Good luck :)
